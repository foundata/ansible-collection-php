## Supported tags<a id="tags"></a>

It might be useful and faster to only call parts of the role by using tags:

- `run_php_setup`: Manage basic resources, such as packages or service users.
- `run_php_config`: Manage settings, such as adapting or creating configuration files.
- `run_php_service`: Manage services and daemons, such as running states and service boot configurations.

There are also tags usually not meant to be called directly but listed for the sake of completeness** and edge cases:

- `run_php_always`, `always`: Tasks needed by the role itself for internal role setup and the Ansible environment.

## Role variables<a id="variables"></a>

See [`defaults/main.yml`](./defaults/main.yml) for all available role parameters and their description. [`vars/main.yml`](./vars/main.yml) contains internal variables you should not override (but their description might be interesting).

Additionally, there are variables read from other roles and/or the global scope (for example, host or group vars) as follows:

- None right now.
